## Research Findings:

During my analysis, I uncovered several key findings:

1. **Breakthrough Year:** The year 2023 marked a significant milestone for the company, with the highest revenue generated (42 million in 2023) and the acquisition of the most new customers (10,000 in 2023).
   
2. **Regional Insights:** Approximately 50% of all sales originate from the Southwest US, Canada, and the Northwest US, with a significant portion of them conducted online.

3. **Top Revenue Category:** The highest revenue was attributed to the Bikes category.

Through these insights, we aim to provide actionable intelligence to drive informed decision-making within the organization.
